                          p Columnist Kelvin MacKenzie has been suspended by The Sun after he expressed "wrong" and "unfunny" views about the people of Liverpool.

                          p In an article published on Friday, MacKenzie compared Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, who has a grandfather born in Nigeria, to a "gorilla".

                          p He said men with similar "pay packets" in Liverpool were "drug dealers".

                          p Merseyside Police are investigating whether his comments constitute a "racial hate crime".

                          p The Sun apologised "for the offence caused" and added that it was "unaware of Barkley's heritage".
